# JDListInstalledPlugins

## Overview

Are you using a lot of XCode Plugins?

This plugin will give you an overview of all installed Plugins. With it you can easily open their directories, or delete them right out of Xcode.  
*This is tested only on OS X 10.8 with Xcode 4.6.*

It adds a new MenuItem "Manage Plugins" in the Edit Menu of Xcode:
