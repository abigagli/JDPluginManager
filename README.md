# JDListInstalledPlugins

## Overview

Using a lot of XCode Plugins? This will give you an overview of all installed Plugins and open their directories easily.

I'm [@jaydee3](http://twitter.com/jaydee3) on Twitter.

## Installation

Simply build the Xcode project and restart Xcode. The plugin will automatically be installed in `~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Plug-ins`. To uninstall, just remove the plugin from there (and restart Xcode).

If you get a "Permission Denied" error while building, please see [this issue](https://github.com/omz/ColorSense-for-Xcode/issues/1).

This is tested on OS X 10.8 with Xcode 4.6.
